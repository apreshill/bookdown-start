A classic approach to probability is simply expressed as:  
$$P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes to E}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$  

So, procedures for counting are essential to determining P(E).  

_Example:_ \hspace{3mm} 

a) P(birthday on a Monday)  vs. 

b) P(2 persons chosen at random have a birthday on the same day of the week.)  


a) P(E) = 1/7  

$\hspace{4mm}$ For (b), draw a tree.  

$\hspace{20mm}$ First person's birthday $\hspace{35mm}$ Second person's birthday

\vspace*{3mm}
Sample space represented by a point ($D_{1}, D_{2}$) \quad e.g. (M, M), (M, T) etc.  
How many points? For each day assigned to person 1, there are 7 assigned to person 2. Thus, there are 7x7=49 possible pairs. Only  seven of these are of the type $D_{1}=D_{2}$, thus, P(E) =1/7.  

\vspace*{3mm}

**Theorem 1-24.**  
If a choice consists of **two** steps, of which one can be made in **m** ways, and the other in **n** ways, then the whole choice can be made in **m** x **n** ways. This can be generalized to **k** steps so the total could be made in $n_{1} \times n_{2} \times n_{3} \times ... \times n_{k}$ ways.  

\vspace{2mm}
_Example:_ 

A test consists of 12 multiple-choice questions, each having 4 alternatives. In how many ways can one mark answers? The first item can be made in 4 ways, the second 4 ways, etc. -- so the total is $4^{12} = 16,777,216$. The probability of answering all questions correctly by random guessing is $1/4^{12} \approx 6 x 10^{-8}$.  

The probability of getting **all the answers wrong** is $3^{12}/4^{12} \approx 0.03$.  

It's hard not to do **anything** right!  

#Permutations -- Ordered Samples  

Given a set or population of n elements, $a_{1}, a_{2}, ... a_{n}$ an **ordered** arrangement $a_{j1}, a_{j2}, ... a_{jr}$ of r symbols is an **ordered sample** of size r.   

Consider _two cases_:

I. Sampling **with** replacement  

In how many different ways can you select a 5-card ordering from a deck without regard to suit? [assume shuffling after each choice].  

There are n = 13 possible values. The sample size is r = 5.  

The first card can be picked in 13 ways, the second in 13 ways, etc. So the total possibilities are $13^{5}$ = 371,293.  

For example, the probability of the ordering A, K, Q, J, 10  

P(A, K, Q, J, 10) = 1/$13^{5} \approx$ 2.69 x $10^{-6}$.  

Note that this probability would be the same for _any_ particular 5-card ordering without regard to suit.  

II. Sampling **without** replacement  

In how many ways can you select a 5-card ordering from a deck (_let suits count here_) **without** replacement?  

The first card can be chosen in 52 ways; the seond in 51; ... ; the 5th in 48, so the number of ways is 52 * 51 * 50 * 49 * 48 = 311,875,200.  

An ordering is called a **permutation** and the number of permutations of r elements taken from n elements (n $\geq$ r) is denoted $_{n}P_{r}$. 

$_{n}P_{r}$ = n (n - 1)(n - 2)...[n-(r - 1)]= n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... (n - r + 1)  

If r = n, $_{n}P_{r}$ is just n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... 1.

\vspace*{3mm} 

Note that  

n (n - 1)(n - 2) ... (n - r + 1) = $\displaystyle\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$.  

To see this, multiply and divide $_{n}P_{r}$ above by (n-r)!.

(Remember, by definition 0! = 1).  

What is the P(A, K, Q, J, 10) **without** replacement -- _not counting suits_?  

There are 4 of each value and the values are distinct, so the A can be picked in 4 ways, etc. The P(A) in the first draw is 4/52, the P(K) on the second draw is 4/51, etc.  

So, P(A, K, Q, J, 10) = (4/52)(4/51) ... (4/48)  

$\displaystyle \frac{4^{5}}{_{52}P_{5}} = \frac{4^{5}}{52!/47!} \approx 3.28 \times  10^{-6}$   [Don't count on this happening!]  

The number of possible orderings of the whole deck (suits included) is $52! \approx 8 \times 10^{67}$.  

No wonder the notation, !  

&nbsp;  

**Theorem 1-25**. For a population of n elements and a subset of r distinct elements, there are $n_{r}$ different samples **with** replacement and $_{n}P_{r}$ **without** replacement.  

If not all the elements are distinct, that is $n_{1}, n_{2}, ... n_{r}$ are alike, then  
$$_{n}P_{n_{r}} = \frac{n!}{n_{1}!n_{2}!n_{3}!...n_{r}!}$$  

Use your intuition here. Take the elements $n_{1}$.  

These are all alike so the $n_{1}!$ orderings are indistinguishable, so they must be divided out in getting the total $_{n}P_{n_{1}}$, etc.  

\vspace{2mm}
_Example:_ 

What is the number of distinguishable letter orderings of the word Mississippi?

$$_{11}P_{4i's, 4s's, 2p's} = \frac{11!}{4! 4! 2!} = 34,650$$  


#Combinations - Unordered Samples  

Consider this problem:  

$\hspace*{20mm}$ How many student committees of 3 each can be made from 100 students?  
$\hspace*{20mm}$ Here we are **not** concerned with ordering in the committees  
$\hspace*{20mm}$ [Sample (A, B, C) = (C, A, B), etc.]  

$\hspace*{20mm}$ Start as **if you were concerned with order**. You know that the number of **ordered** 
$\hspace*{20mm}$ samples of 3 taken from 10 is:  

$$_{10}P_{3} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} = \frac{10!}{7!}$$  

&nbsp;  

$\hspace*{20mm}$ Now, you know there are r! = 3! orderings for a given sample. But, in a committee, these  
$\hspace*{20mm}$ different orderings are unimportant. So, they should be divided out. [Just like the case of  
$\hspace*{20mm}$ "Mississippi" above]. So, the number of 3-person committees would be  

$$\binom{n}{r} = _{n}C_{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = _{10}C_{3} = \frac{10!}{3!7!} = 70$$  

$\hspace*{20mm}$ Such samples are called **combinations**.  

&nbsp;  

**Theorem 1-26**. \qquad A population of n elements possesses $\binom {n}{r}$ different subsets of size $r \leq n$ where  
$$\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = _{n}C_{r} = C(n, r)$$  

If r=n, there is only **one** possibility  
$$\binom{n}{n} = \frac{n!}{n!0!} = 1$$  
\begin{center} (Remember, 0! is defined as 1). 
\end{center}

&nbsp;  

You should become very familiar (and prove) a number of combination identitites, for example.  

1) $\displaystyle\binom{n}{n} = 1 = \binom{n}{0}$  

2) $\displaystyle\binom{n}{1} = \binom{n}{n - 1}$  

3) $\displaystyle\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-1}$  

[Selecting a committee of size r automatically leaves a committee of size n- r].  

4) $\displaystyle\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n-1}{r} + \binom{n-1}{r-1} \qquad$  (prove)  

5) $\displaystyle\binom{n+1}{r} = \binom{n}{r-1} + \binom{n}{r} \qquad$  (prove)  

Note that $\binom{n}{r}$ first increases, then decreases symmetrically as r increases, e.g.  

$\displaystyle\binom{3}{r}:$  

$\displaystyle\binom{3}{0} = 1$

$\displaystyle\binom{3}{1} = 3$  

$\displaystyle\binom{3}{2} = 3$  

$\displaystyle\binom{3}{3} = 1$  

You may note also at this point that these are coefficients of $(a + b)^{3}$. More on this soon.

###Poker Hands  

These give a good work out with combinatorics. A poker hand (say, 5 card draw) is a 5-member committee drawn from a set of 52.  

The number of 5 card poker hands is  
$\displaystyle\binom{52}{5} = 2,598,960$  

[Compare this with the number of bridge hands -- $\binom{52}{13} \approx 6/35*10^{11}$]  

_Example 1_: What is the probability of getting a Queen of Spades ($Q\spadesuit$) in a poker hand?  

There are several ways to do this:

 1. Hard way:  
$$P(Q\spadesuit)_{\text{1st card}} + P(Q\spadesuit)_{\text{2nd}} + P(Q\spadesuit)_{\text{3rd}} + P(Q\spadesuit)_{\text{4th}} + P(Q\spadesuit)_{\text{5th}} = 5(1/52) = 5/52$$  

These are mutually exclusive events.  

 2. Better way:  
Consider the $Q\spadesuit$ as a "committee" of 1 from the deck. There is just one way to pick this committee. After you pick this "committee," you pick the remaining 4 cards from the rest of the deck (n=51), so  
$$P(Q_{s}) = \frac{1 \binom{51}{4}}{\binom{52}{5}} = 5/52$$  

 3. Another better way:  
$$P(Q\spadesuit) = 1 - P(Q'\spadesuit)$$  
The number of hands _without_ a $Q\spadesuit$ is $\binom {51}{5}$, so,   

$P(Q'\spadesuit) = \displaystyle\frac{\binom{51}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}} = \frac{47}{52}$  

$Thus 1 - P(Q'\spadesuit) = P(Q\spadesuit) = 1 - (47/52) = 5/52$  

Notice that $P(Q'\spadesuit)$ is also equal to  

$$P(Q'\spadesuit)_{1} \times P(Q'\spadesuit)_{2} \times P(Q'\spadesuit)_{3} \times P(Q'\spadesuit)_{4} \times P(Q'\spadesuit)_{5}$$ 
$$\text{("and")}$$  
$$\binom{51}{52} \binom{50}{51} \binom{49}{50} \binom{48}{49} \binom{47}{48} = \frac{47}{52} = \frac{_{51} P_{5}}{_{52} P_{5}}$$  

&nbsp;  

_Example 2_: What's the probability that a poker hand contains **at least** one ace?  
P(at least one ace) = $1 - P(A')$  

There are 4 aces, so that leaves 48 non-aces from which we take a committee of 5. So,  
$$P(A') = \frac {\binom{48}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}} \qquad \qquad \text{and}$$  
$$P(\text{at least 1A}) = 1 - \frac {\binom{48}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}} = 0.341$$  


_Example 3:_ What's the probability of all hearts?  [Could be a straight flush!]  

There are 13 hearts and we form a committee of 5 $\binom{13}{5}$ so,  

$$P(\text{all hearts}) = \frac{\binom{13}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}} \approx 4.95 \times 10^{-4}$$  

Again, another way to approach this is an ordering:  

$$P(\text{all hearts}) = \frac{13}{52} \times \frac{12}{51} \times \frac{11}{50} \times \frac{10}{49} \times \frac{9}{48} = \frac{\frac{13!}{8!}}{\frac{52!}{47!}} = \frac{_{13} P_{5}}{_{52} P_{5}}$$
