###1. One Pair  

Select from 13 possible values:  
13  

Select 2 from 4 of the given value:  
13 $\displaystyle\binom {4}{2}$  

Select 3 from the remaining 12 values:  
13 $\displaystyle\binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{3}$  

There are 4 possible suits for each of these three cards, $4^{3}$, so  
P(1 pair) = $\displaystyle\frac {13 \displaystyle\binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{3} 4^{3}}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.4226  

###2. Two Pair  

Select two from the 13 possible values:  
$\displaystyle\binom{13}{2}$  

Select two from **each** of the 4 above values:  
$\displaystyle\binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{4}{2}$  

For each of these there are 48 possible values for the 5th card. 
Two of the unselected pair values must be subtracted to avoid three-of-a-kind, so there remain 48-4 = **44** possible cards for the 5th spot, so   
P(2 pair) = $\displaystyle\frac {\displaystyle\binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{2} \binom{4}{2} .44}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.0475  

###3. Three-of-a-kind  

Select from 13 possible values:  
13  

Select 3 from 4 of that value:  
13 $\displaystyle\binom {4}{3}$  

Select 2 more cards from 12 other values:  
13 $\displaystyle\binom{4}{3} \binom{12}{2}$  

There are 4 possible suits for each of these last two cards, $4^{2}$, so    
P(three-of-a-kind) = $\displaystyle\frac {13 \displaystyle\binom{4}{3} \binom{12}{2} 4^{2}}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.02113  

###4. Straight  

A straight may begin with 10 possible values (A-10):  
10  

For each card value in a straight, there are 4 possible suits, $4^{5}$:  
(10)($4^{5}$)  

But we don't want to count _straight flushes_ (there are 40 of them, see below), so  
P(straight) = $\displaystyle\frac {\displaystyle10 \cdot 4^{5} -40}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.00392  


###5. Flush

There are 13 possible values for the five cards:  
$\displaystyle\binom{13}{5}$  

For each there are 4 suits:  
$\displaystyle\binom {13}{5}$ 4

Subtract straight flushes, so      
P(flush) = $\displaystyle\frac {\displaystyle\binom{13}{5} \cdot 4 - 40}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.00198  

###6. Full House  

There are 13 possible values for the 3-of-a-kind:  
13  

Select 3 from the 4 of that value:  
13 $\displaystyle\binom {4}{3}$  

12 values are left for the pair:  
13 $\displaystyle\binom {4}{3}$ 12  

Select 2 from 4 of that value, so  
P(full house) = $\displaystyle\frac {13 \displaystyle\binom{4}{3} 12 \binom{4}{2}}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.0014  

###7. Four-of-a-kind  

Select one of 13 values:  
13  

There are 48 cards left for the 5th card so,  
P(four-of-a-kind) = $\displaystyle\frac {13 \cdot 48}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.00024  

###8. Straight Flush  

There are 10 possible straights:  
10  

Each could have four possible suits, 4, so  
P(straight flush) = $\displaystyle\frac {10 \cdot 4}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.0000154  

###9. Royal Flush  

There are only 4 (one for each suit), so  
P(royal flush) = $\displaystyle\frac {4}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}}$ = 0.00000154

###10. Bust
[No card alike, but no straight, flush, or straight flush]

There are 13 possible values from which 5 are drawn:  
$\displaystyle\binom{13}{5}$

Each of these values has 4 possible suits, 4$^5$:

$\displaystyle\binom{13}{5} 4^5$

Subtract straights:

$\displaystyle\binom{13}{5} 4^5 - [10 \cdot 4^5 - 40]$

Subtract flushes:

$\displaystyle\binom{13}{5} 4^5 - [10 \cdot 4^5 - 40] - \left[\displaystyle\binom{13}{5}\cdot 4 - 40\right]$

Subtract straight flushes, so

P(bust) = $\displaystyle\frac{\displaystyle\binom{13}{5}4^5 - [10 \cdot 4^5 - 40] - \left[\displaystyle\binom{13}{5}\cdot 4 - 40\right] - 40}{\displaystyle\binom{52}{5}} = 0.501$

So, you have about an even chance of getting *something* that counts in a five-card hand.
